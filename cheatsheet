Vim Eunuch
:Delete: Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
:Unlink: Like :Delete, but keeps the now empty buffer.

:Rename: Like :Move, but relative to the current file's containing directory.
:Chmod: Change the permissions of the current file.
:Mkdir: Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.
:Cfind: Run find and load the results into the quickfix list.
:Clocate: Run locate and load the results into the quickfix list.
:Lfind/:Llocate: Like above, but use the location list.
:Wall: Write every open window. Handy for kicking off tools like guard.
